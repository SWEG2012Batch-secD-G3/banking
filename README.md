# banking

A basic banking system project, written in C++. 

# About the project

Bank Management System is based on a concept of recording customer’s account details. Here the user can perform all the tasks like creating an account, deposit amount, withdraw amount, check balance, view all account holders detail, close an account and modify an account. There’s no login system for this project because the system is built only for the purpose of serving customers by the bank employee. so the system is not directly used by random customer instead is used by only the emploee.
